# Personal Website

#### Description: 
Personal Website made with HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and API. The website features a project portfolio page that can be used to show off projects I worked on. For now I have one project I made just for Cs50. It's a weather app that works as a nested page within the homepage itself. I plan on adding more in the future to beef up my work portfolio. I also have a resume page (resume.html) that simply has a copy of my resume for people to read, however, for privacy reasons mines not there right now. The home page is a combination of (Index2.html) and (index3.html) that has seemless scrolling between the pages. Another page in the thoughts page that has some of my favorite quotes. Originally I wanted to use mySQL to give users the ablility to add their own quotes, but after going down a long rabbit hole I sadly had to abandon the idea, as I struggled to integrate it on my own. The final page is the contacts page (contact.html) that features a drop down leading to buttons that allow people copy my number and email to their clipboard. All in all, this project taught me a lot, and I'm very happy I took this class. Thank you CS50.
